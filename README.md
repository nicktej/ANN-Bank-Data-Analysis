# Bank Data Analysis

This is an ANN used to analyze real bank data to determine which customers are loyal, and which will leave the bank.

## Mechanics and Measurements

The ANN has 3 hidden layers, and uses an Adam optimizer. The accuracy I achieve was 86%. 

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3. You will need TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
